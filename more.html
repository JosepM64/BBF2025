                    <p class="text-primary-emphasis d-inline" style="width: 1100px;height: 100%;">To get around Barcelona by public transportation, there are different types of tickets available:<br><br><strong>T-Casual card:</strong> It costs €12.15 and allows for 10 individual trips, including transfers between the metro, bus, and train in Zone 1 within a 75-minute time limit. (Zone 1: Barcelona and surrounding cities.)<br><br><strong>T-Usual card:</strong> Until the end of the year, it costs €21,35 and allows for unlimited individual trips with the same conditions as the T-Casual. It also includes the journey to or from the airport.<br><br>If you arrive in Barcelona by car, the easiest option is to ask your hotel to reserve a parking space for you. There are also underground and outdoor car parks, but they are generally more expensive than those at hotels. The most economical option is to park in a free space near the Poblenou area, but there are not many parking spaces available. Moreover, we do not recommend using a car to get around the city.<br><br>From the airport, you can reach Barcelona by various means of transport:<br><br><strong>Metro</strong>. L9 sud. It stops at both terminal T1 and T2 and goes to Zona Universitària. During the journey, you can transfer to other metro lines, buses, trains, and railways and it takes about an hour to reach the city center. If you buy the T-Usual, this trip is included, but if you buy the T-Casual, you will have to purchase an extra ticket that costs €5.50 per trip.<br><br><strong>Train</strong>. R2 Nord. The station is at terminal T2. If your flight arrives at terminal T1, there is a free shuttle that will take you to T2. A train leaves every 30 minutes and the journey to Passeig de Gràcia takes about 30 minutes. The ticket costs €2.55 per trip, but the T-Usual can also be used.<br><br><strong>Aerobús</strong>. Leaves every 5 minutes from both T1 and T2 (they are two different buses) and the journey takes about 30 minutes to plaça Catalunya. It has several stops along the way. A single ticket costs €7.25 and a round-trip ticket costs €12.50. Tickets can be purchased online or directly on the bus.<br><br><strong>Taxi</strong>. There are taxi stands at both terminals. The trip to the center of Barcelona takes between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the arrival point and traffic, and starts at €40.<br><br>To get to the Casino de l’Aliança del Poblenou by metro, the nearest station is Poblenou (Line 4, yellow), about 600 meters away. The metro ends at 2:00 AM on Fridays. On Saturdays, it runs 24 hours, and on Sundays, it finishes at midnight.</p>

                    <p class="text-primary-emphasis d-inline" style="width: 1100px;height: 100%;">BCNSwing believes Swing is a live art form, and we wish to approach these artistic expressions with respect and appreciation.&nbsp;<br>We believe that everyone has the right to enjoy these activities with complete peace of mind, and that everyone has a responsibility to build a safe environment and contribute to the well-being of the whole community.<br><br>No type of violent, intimidating, sexist, racist, or exclusionary behavior will be tolerated under any circumstances. If you see or experience any improper behavior during the festival please contact the organization team immediately or the purple spot called Punt lila, which you’ll find by the check in table, specially created for this.<br><br>The organization commits itself to treat any report with respect, sensitivity and confidentiality, whether from the dancers, from our local scene or from other places. Also, the organization reserves the right to expel anyone who acts inappropriately.<br><br>Dancing is a very physical activity and as such, everyone is responsible for their own physical safety and that of others around them. So, practice safe dance floor movements, apologize if you accidentally bump into another person, do not offer unsolicited advice or instructions, nor perform aerials on the social dance floor.<br><br>Please also take special hygiene care and review your personal odor because it is not pleasant to dance with someone who has bad body odor, bad breath or wears clothes with excessive sweat. We ask that you bring spare clothes and take extra care of your hygiene in order to avoid unpleasant moments for the other dancers.<br><br>By following this code of conduct, we will generate a much more pleasant environment for everyone where we can enjoy dancing and personal exchange.</p>

They are easily accessible by metro or urban buses, with a cost of just over €1 per journey (T-Casual for 1 zone). The metro closes at 2 AM on Fridays, and operates throughout the night on Saturdays. There are also night buses throughout the night covering most areas.<br><br>Another recommendation is to avoid using single-use plastics. We can start with the three night time parties at the Casino. We <strong>will provide water, and you can bring your own reusable cup.</strong><br><br>It's a fair deal, isn't it?</p>
